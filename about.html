            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Rise Her Collective was born from a simple but powerful belief: when women lift each other up, 
                entire communities rise. What started as conversations between friends about how we could make 
                a real difference has grown into a movement fueled by love, community, and delicious homemade treats.
            </p>
            <p>
                We discovered that our shared passion for baking could be more than just a hobby—it could be 
                a vehicle for change. Every batch of cookies, every beautiful cake, every warm cinnamon roll 
                represents an opportunity to support women in our community who are building brighter futures 
                for themselves and their families.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Rise Her Collective combines the comfort of homemade baked goods with the power of 
                collective action. When you order from us, you're not just getting something sweet—you're 
                becoming part of a community that believes in the power of women supporting women, one treat 
                at a time.

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p class="mission-statement">
                <strong>To empower, uplift, and support women in our community by providing resources, 
                opportunities, and a network of care that helps them rise to their fullest potential.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe that every woman deserves access to the tools and support she needs to build 
                a life of dignity, independence, and purpose. Through our fundraising efforts, we channel 
                the warmth of community and the joy of sharing into tangible support—whether that's helping 
                with education costs, providing resources for career development, supporting women's shelters, 
                or funding mentorship programs that create lasting change.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our mission is rooted in the understanding that when one woman succeeds, we all rise together. 
                Every purchase you make, every share, and every recommendation helps us build a stronger, 
                more supportive community where women can thrive.
